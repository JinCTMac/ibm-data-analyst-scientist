Intro to Types

You can have different data types in Python, from integers to floats, strings, arrays, etc.

To find the data type in Python, we can use the type method.

type(11) = int
type(12.34) = float

We can change the type of a variable in Python using type casting, such as changing an int to a float. This typically only is from int to float and not the other way around, since we would lose the decimal values otherwise.

float(2) = 2 (aka 2.0)
str(1) = "1"
