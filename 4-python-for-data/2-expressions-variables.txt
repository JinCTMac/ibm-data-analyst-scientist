Expressions and Variables

Expressions are instructions that you can do in Python, whereby values are used with operations to evaluate something down into a single value.

12 + 15 is an expression, for example.

We can assign expressions to a variable, and the variable will represent the result of that expression.

x = 12/4
x = 3
