Expressions and Variables

Expressions are instructions that you can do in Python, whereby values are used with operations to evaluate something down into a single value.

12 + 15 is an expression, for example.

We can assign expressions to a variable, and the variable will represent the result of that expression.

x = 12/4
x = 3

We can execute Python code either in a notebook like Jupyter, or in VScode using the code runner package. Or we can run in a command shell for Python in the command line like with iPython. Anaconda is an open-source distribution that includes multiple packages for working with Python and building a virtual environment, including a GUI to launch applications instead of using the command line.
