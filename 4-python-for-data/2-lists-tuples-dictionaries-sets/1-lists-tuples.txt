Lists and Tuples

Tuples:
  Are an ordered sequence of elements contained inside of (), where each element can be accessed via an index. However, the elements inside of a tuple cannot be changed, as tuples are immutable. We can concatenate and slice tuples.

  tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
  tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
  tup1 + tup2 => (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

  tup1 = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
  tup1[0:4] => will return 1,2,3,4

  We can nest tuples within other tuples.

  tup1 = (1, 2, (3, 4), 5, 6)

Lists:
  An ordered sequence of elements contained inside of [], where each element can be accessed via an index. Elements within a list/array can be changed as arrays/lists are mutable. Common methods include:

  list.pop() - remove last element from array, or a specified element with an index
  list.reverse() - reverse the array
  list.sort() - sort the array from smallest to largest
  list.append() - add element to end of list
  list.insert() - add element at specified index Python_distribution
  list.extend() - add a list to another list

  See list of array methods here (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp)

  We can make a string into a list using the .split() method, which either splits via spaces or any delimiter you want in the parameters.
