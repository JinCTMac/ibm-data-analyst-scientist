Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a collection without integer indexes. They have key-values pairs, where keys are unordered and reference the value. The keys are immutable, while the values are mutable.

The key is used to look up the value associated with it, where we use [] notation to find the value:
  dict["colour"] => will return "red"

We can add new values to the dictionary using [] notation again, but assigning a value.
  dict["car_make"] "Nissan"

To delete a key-value pair from a dictionary, we can use the del method with the dict and key name.
  del(dict["colour"])

We can verify the existence of an item in the dictionary using the in function.
  "Thriller" in Dict => returns either True or False

We can look at the keys or values in a dictionary using .keys() and .values().
  dict.keys()
  dict.values()
