Conditions and Branching
(https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)

We can use logical operators to compare two values and return a boolean telling us if the value is true or false.

Logical operators include:
  <
  >
  == (equality comparison)
  != (not)
  && (and)
  || (or)

We can compare ints, floats, and strings as well.

Conditional statements - if statements:
  if age > 18:
    print("you can go")

Conditional statements - else statements and elif statements:
  if age > 18:
    print("you can go")
  elif age < 18 &&/and age > 16:
    print("you're close")
  else:
    print("you can't go")

Summary of conditional statements:

# If statement example

age = 19
# age = 18

#expression that can be true or false
if age > 18:

    #within an indent, we have the expression that is run if the condition is true
    print("you can enter" )

# elif, or else if, represents another condition that has its code executed when the conditions above are not met, those conditions can be other elif statements or the main if statement
elif age == 18:
  print("you must go here")

# else is run when neither the main if statement nor the remaining elif statements are evaluated to true
else:
  print("you can't enter)

#The statements after the if statement will run regardless if the condition is true or false
print("move on")
