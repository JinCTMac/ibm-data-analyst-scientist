Conditions and Branching

We can use logical operators to compare two values and return a boolean telling us if the value is true or false.

Logical operators include:
  <
  >
  == (equality comparison)
  != (not)
  && (and)
  || (or)

We can compare ints, floats, and strings as well.

Conditional statements - if statements:
  if age > 18:
    print("you can go")
  print("you can't go")

Conditional statements - else statements:
  if age > 18:
    print("you can go")
  elif age < 18 && age > 16:
    print("you're close")
  else:
    print("you can't go")
