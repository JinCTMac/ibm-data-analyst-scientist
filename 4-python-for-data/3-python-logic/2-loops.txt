Loops/Iteration

range():
  The range() function produces a list/array of numbers from the number range specified, from the starting value up to the ending value - 1.

  range(10,15)
  [10,11,12,13,14]

For loops:
  Loops perform a task again and again until the end conditions/break conditions are fulfilled.

  for i in range(0,3):
    print(i)
  => will return 0, 1, 2

Enumerate:
  We can use the enumerate function to loop through a list or other enumerable object and also display other values i.e. their index.

  for i, square, in enumerate(squares):
    print(i, square)

While loops:
  While loops loop while a condition is true (or false).

  i = 0
  while squares[i] == "orange":
    print(squares[i])
    i += 1
