Loops/Iteration
///
range():
  The range() function produces a list/array of numbers from the number range specified, from the starting value up to the ending value - 1.

  range(10,15)
  [10,11,12,13,14]

For loops:
  Loops perform a task again and again until the end conditions/break conditions are fulfilled.

  for i in range(0,3):
    print(i)
  => will return 0, 1, 2

  # For loop example
  dates = [1982,1980,1973]
  N = len(dates)

  for i in range(N):
      print(dates[i])

  # Example of for loop
  for i in range(0, 8):
      print(i)

  In Python, we can also access list elements directly to loop over.
  for year in dates:
    print(year)

Enumerate:
  We can use the enumerate function to loop through a list or other enumerable object and also display other values i.e. their index.

  for i, square, in enumerate(squares):
    print(i, square)

While loops:
  While loops loop while a condition is true (or false).

  i = 0
  while squares[i] == "orange":
    print(squares[i])
    i += 1

  # Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute

  PlayListRatings = [10, 9.5, 10, 8, 7.5, 5, 10, 10]

  i = 0
  while i < len(PlayListRatings):
      print(PlayListRatings[i])
      if PlayListRatings[i] < 6:
          break
      i += 1
