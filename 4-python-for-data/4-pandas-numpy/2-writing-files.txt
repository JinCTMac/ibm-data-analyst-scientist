Writing Files with Open

Write:
  We can use the open() method again to write a new file, or overwrite an existing file.

  We set the mode to "w", and the file name parameter to a new file path and file name.

  file2 = open("new_file_path", "w")

  To actually write a string to a file, we can use the .write() method, with the string we want to write to the file inside.

  file2.write("This is line A \n")
  file2.write("This is line B \n")

Writing multiple lines:
  We can use the with function to write to a file instead to save having to close. If we want to write multiple lines to a file, one way is to build an array with the strings we want to populate the file with.

  Lines = ["string1", "string2"]

  with open("file_path", "w") AS file1:
    for line in Lines:
      file1.write(line)

Appending:
  Using the append mode will just write to an existing file, adding new lines.

Copying a file:
  We can copy over a file's contents to another file using simple iteration logic.

  with open("file_path", "r") as readfile:
    with open("file_path", "w") as writefile:
      for line in readfile:
        writefile.write(line)
