Loading Data with Pandas

Libraries/packages are collections of code and methods that make it easier to solve certain problems. Pandas is a common library for data analysis.

Importing:
  We just use the import keyword and the name of the library to import an installed library.

  import pandas

  We can give them aliases as well.

  import pandas as pd

  To load a CSV file, we can use the built-in methods that pandas has, like pandas.read_csv().

  csv_file = 'file1.csv'
  df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)

Dataframes:
  Dataframes are a format within Python and R that enable much easier data access.

  Dataframes have their own methods that enable simple and quick data analysis. df.head() for example returns the top 5 rows within the dataframe.

  df.head()

  We can also turn files other than CSVs, such as Excel files.

  pd.read_excel()

  Dataframes have rows and columns, and we can create a dataframe from a dictionary, where the keys are the column names, and the values are found in the rows.

  To extract a new dataframe from an existing dataframe, we assign a variable and enclose the columns we want to extract from the existing dataframe in [] brackets.

  x = df[['length', 'height']]
