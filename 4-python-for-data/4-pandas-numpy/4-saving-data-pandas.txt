Working with and saving data in Pandas

We can work with and save the results of a dataframe analysis in other formats.

Pandas methods:
  df['col_name'].unique() = allows us to find the unique values within a certain column, similar to a SELECT DISTINCT in SQL.

  df1.to_csv('csv_name.csv') = allows us to save a dataframe to a new csv file.

Let's say we want to extract a new dataframe from an existing one, but the release date has to be on or after 1980. We can write this to a new dataframe like so, using the method for creating a new dataframe and checking against the conditions:

  df1 = df[df['released'] >= 1980]

Creating a dataframe from a dictionary:
   #write your code here

  dict = {"Student": ["David", "Samuel", "Terry", "Evan"],
        "Age": [27, 24, 22, 32],
        "Country": ["UK", "Canada", "China", "Evan"],
        "Course": ["Python", "Data Structures", "Machine Learning", "Web Development"],
        "Marks": [85, 72, 89, 76]}

  df2 = pd.DataFrame(dict)
  df2
