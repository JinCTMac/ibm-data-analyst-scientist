Analysing Data in Pandas

import pandas as pd

path = "file_path"
df = pd.read_csv(path)

df.head():
  We can use the .head() method to print the first 5 rows of a df to look at.

Series:
  We can view a column as a series, or a 1-d dataframe. It will just print out all the values in a single column to look at.

  x = df['Length']
  x
