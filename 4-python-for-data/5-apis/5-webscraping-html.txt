HTML for Webscraping

What is webscraping?
  Lots of useful information is available on websites, such as real estate prices, review scores, etc.

  If you understand HTML, you can use Python to scrape that information from that website.

Let's say you want to extract names and salaries from a website. HTML is comprised of elements, such as <body></body>, <div></div>, <p></p>, <a></a>, etc.

The data we want of the element is enclosed within the tags of an element. Some tags like <a></a> have attributes like href, class, id, etc which can be used for further identification of an element using getElementById and other DOM methods.

Tables in HTML are created using the <table></table>, alongside <tr></tr> or table rows, and <td></td> or table data. Each <tr></tr> element represents a row within a table, and within each row we define <td></td> to represent the table columns and values.
