Webscraping

What is webscraping?
  - As in previous section, if we want to gather information we can use webscraping to automatically gather information from a website.

Getting started with webscraping:
  To get started, we just need two libraries: requests and beautiful-soup.

  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  html = "<your_html></your_html>

  We parase this bit of HTML using the BeautifulSoup() method, providing it the html file and the version of html we are parsing. This returns a nested data structure.

  soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html5lib')

BeautifulSoup objects:
  BeautifulSoup objects let us access the contents of HTML elements that we specify.

  tag_object = soup.title
  soup.title => <title>Page Title</title>

  We need to consider the DOM when accessing elements in this way.

  We can find parent elements to an element using the soup.parent method.

  We can find child elements using the name of the element soup.b for example.

  We can find the sibling of an element (or the element directly underneath in the HTML itself) using soup.next_sibling.

  We can find the attributes of an element using soup.attrs.

  We can find the contents of an element using soup.string.

Tables:
  We can specifically identify HTML tables and turn them into BeautifulSoup objects. These objects are iterables similar to a list, and thus we can iterate through them row-by-row.

Scraping a webpage.
  For scraping a webpage, we also need the requests library.

  We use the get method to get the website, and then we can parse that webpage's HTML using BeautifulSoup.
