Importing Datasets 1 - The Problem

Why data analysis?
  - Data is everywhere
  - Manually or digitally i.e. via clickstream
  - Data is not information, however.
  - Data analysis and science allows us to unlock the information we need from the data, and allows us to predict the unknown or the future.

Lets say Tom wants to sell a car, but he doesn't know which price he should put, he wants to sell his car for the most money he can, but also wants to set a reasonable price so that others will buy. He wants to know:
  - What data is there on other cars and their characteristics?
  - What features of cars affect their price?
    - Colour? Brand? Age?
  - We need to ask the right questions in terms of data.
